Timeâ€“series Sankey diagram of the rising complexity of dark money networks, where huge amounts of cash are funnelled 
through 501(c)(4) nonprofit organizations to influence elections. Apart from the tax benefits, groups 
classified as 501(c)(4)s are not required to disclose their donors to the public, 
making these campaign contributions practically untraceable.
